Password Complexity Checker

The program takes user input and rates the combination of lower case letters, upper case letters, numerics, special characters, and white space counts that are entered. The program measures the complexity on a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 being the weakest and 5 being the strongest or most complex. The user gets immediate feedback from the program on the level of complexity and makes recommendations accordingly depending on the returned score. 

This is an invaluable tool for anyone to be able to check the complexity of a password they may wish to use for logins to any apps or programs they used. 

In this exercise, in addition to my comments from the skills I learned in the Caesar Cipher implementation, I learned also to: 

Consider how the program is interacting with the user and have it converse with the user correctly. I also had to correct loop issues allowing the user to terminate the program by indicating they are done entering passwords, as well as allowing the user to enter another password to check its complexity if they wish to do so.
